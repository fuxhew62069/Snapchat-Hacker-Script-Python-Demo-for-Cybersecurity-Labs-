## 🚨 Disclaimer

This script is strictly for **ethical hacking education**, **cybersecurity research**, and **penetration testing labs**.

> 🔐 This tool does **not** connect to real Snapchat servers, nor does it access any private user data.  
> All simulations are performed using **mock data** and **offline test environments**.

## 🔍 Overview

This Python demo shows how 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) and session tokens might be simulated in a Snapchat-like environment.

It is used to:

- Teach red-team trainees how session spoofing attacks **could** work
- Help cybersecurity students understand authentication flow
- Demonstrate secure login handling techniques

---

## 🧠 Educational Objectives

- Simulate 2FA bypass logic (in theory)
- Test session handling in controlled environments
- Train cybersecurity students on secure coding principles
- Raise awareness about potential social engineering exploits

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Written in **Python 3.x**
- Modular codebase (easy to extend)
- Dummy user database and OTP system
- CLI interface for red team training
- Clear logging and simulated attack paths
